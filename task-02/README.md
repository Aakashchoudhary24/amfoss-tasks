  # Journey - 
  ## Part I :
     
  ## Part II :
     1) Used the command : grep -r "holy\|good"  ~/amfoss-tasks/task-02/Terminal-Chaos/Arrakis-dex/
     2) Found Moonbloom and Mistveil as the only files containing both "holy" and "good"
     3) Applied the given algo and got the holy spell : LnnmknnlLhrsdhk
     2) Defeated KharnokTheBloodForged
     3) On using tree again, observed that  Celestial Veil Amulet.txt and LightBook.txt were the new files that appeared
     4) On using tree found two files engrave.txt and Voidgate.sh 
     5) Used the code from the Lightbook i.e. dWIuY29tL2FtYW5ze and got the output as : ub.com/amans
     6) The output partially completes some part of the site i.e. https://gith that was decoded 
        in the Voidgate.sh file in the main branch.
     7) Moved further to The-Dark-Realm-I
