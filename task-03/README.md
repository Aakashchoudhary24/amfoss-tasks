# Time taken to complete the task - 1 da

# My approach - 
## Seeing the various languages and assuming their programs might vary a lot I broke down the task into parts
   1) Pick a language at a time
   2) Build the pyramid of asteriks
   3) Google and learn the file handling procedure in the language
   4) The diamond must be a text file
   5) Figure how to convert and transfer the output to the output file via a function and file handling.

# Python - 
   1) Naturally I started with Python cos of being familiar with it and it's syntax being simpler
   2) This helped me figure out the above approach for the rest of the languages
   3) The Diamond was easy to print via some hit and trial 
   4) Main issue was printing the diamond to the txt file 
   5) I repeatedly got the issue of the output being None
   6) Some googling got me on track and I changed the function to return string output, hence the task was then over.
