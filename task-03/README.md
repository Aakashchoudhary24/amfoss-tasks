# My approach - 
## Seeing the various languages and assuming their programs might vary a lot I broke down the task into parts
   1) Pick a language at a time
   2) Build the pyramid of asteriks
   3) Google and learn the file handling procedure in the language
   4) The diamond must be a text file
   5) Figure how to convert and transfer the output to the output file via a function and file handling.

## Initial procedure: 
   1) Naturally I started with Python cos of being familiar with it and it's syntax being simpler
   2) This helped me figure out the above approach for the rest of the languages
   3) The Diamond was easy to print via some hit and trial 
   4) Main issue was printing the diamond to the txt file 
   5) I repeatedly got the issue of the output being None
   6) Some googling got me on track and I changed the function to return string output, hence the task was then over.

# Further procedure:
1. Being done with the code in python I moved on to java and javascript as they were the languages I was somewhat familiar with and simply converted the file handling methods via some docs and googling, rest of the diamond printing code was the same with not much difference.
2. Rust, C and C++ were the only languages that I had never used earlier except reading some resource on c++. Though I was unfamiliar with these languages again the only difference with respect to python was the file handling method and the syntax and compiling method. 
3. Overall this task was a fun experience and I found the most intriguing languages to be Rust and C++. Rust for it's simplicity and code readability similar to that of python and 
C++ because it felt like the most minimal/clean language to code with.
