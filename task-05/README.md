# Thought process/ Procedure :
1. Initially on viewing the demo video the contents of the page didn't bother me at all and the task seemed easy to complete
2. Further when I started coding it up, the Terminal struck me hard
3. Though others might have different approaches of building that thing up, I went through the long route of trial and error, it wasn't the
right approach but I won't call it ignorance either.
4. Building the script was mostly googling about javascript because prior to this I had only worked with javascript while working on a React app
for tracking health.
5. The responsive layout though seemed teadious at first was done quickly and didn't require any tutorial/blogs just a search regarding media 
queries.
6. My main goal was to actually make the layout/appearance as similar to that of a linux terminal hence you won't see any buttons, links, 
or other html tags except an add to cart button. Everything is done via the terminal

## Conclusion : 
- Overall the task took an unforeseen amount of time with respect to my knowledge in html,css, javascript.
- Completing this task gave me an immence boost in confidence as I was able to duplicate a terminal as in linux which was also the 
highlight for me in this task.
