# **About Me** :
  Hi, I am Aakash Choudhary. I consider myself a passionate learner, a tech enthusiast and an outgoing person. My hobbies lie on a diverse spectrum and I constantly
  like to approach new topics of interest. Working with people and tech and solving the most minute to big problems is what drives me.
# Why should you choose me ?
  Being driven towards my goals and willing to put in the hours to achieve them is my main motto.
  I am committed to my academics equally as my personal growth i.e. learning new skills and tech to improve myself as a developer.
  For me amFOSS means a whole lot of new opportunities which would be missing otherwise without the proper mentorship and influence. 
# How do I intend on contributing back to the club ?
  Whether it is organizing events, attending hackathons or securing internships I look forward to giving my 100%
  in whatever task the club assigns me.
  I aim to drastically improve my technical skills along-side my communication personal skills via the several events the club will organize or attend in the upcoming years.
# My fields of interest -
  I have decided to dive into Web Development for at-least an year from now
  However, this doesn't in any way restrict my interest in other fields; I am all about exploration and learning.
  I have chosen at web-dev currently because it's the common starting point for various developers and I aim to excel in it as much as I want to excel as an open source contributor.
