# **About Me** -
  Hi, I am Aakash Choudhary. I would consider myself a passionate learner and an outgoing person. My hobbies lie on a diverse spectrum and I constantly
  like to approach new topics of interest. Working with people and tech and solving the most minute to big problems is what drives me.
# Why should you choose me ?
  Being driven towards my goals and willing to put in the hours to achieve them is my main motto.
  I am committed to my academics equally as my personal growth i.e. learning new skills and tech to improve myself as a developer.
  For me amFOSS means a whole lot of new opportunities which would be missing otherwise without the proper mentorship and influence. 
# How do I intend on contributing back to the club ?
  Whether it is organizing events, attending hackathons or securing interships I look forward to giving my 100%
  in whatever task the club assigns me.
  I aim to drastically improve my communicating and technical skills via the various events the club conducts and attends in the upcoming years.
# My fields of interest -
  I have decided to dedicate myself to Web Application Development for the rest of the academic year i.e an year from now.
  This doesn't however restrict my interest in other fields like Mobile app development, AI etc.
  I have choose web dev because it's the common starting point among various developers and though I intend to excel in it, I assure you that
  it won't hamper my overall growth in other fields.
