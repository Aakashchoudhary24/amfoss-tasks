# Thought process: 
1) I had never done any web scraping or used beautifulsoup4 prior to this task.
2) Hence firstly I thoroughly read the README.md of the task and
pointed out the info/resources the task demands. 
3) Naturally I started with reading documentation and 
tutorials on BS4. Following are the resources I referred to :
  a - https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/
  b - https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/
  c - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/beautiful_soup/index.htm
